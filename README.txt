This notebook is a notebook for the Datavidia (Data Science Competition) held by Intitut Teknologi Bandung, 2025.

Fluctuations in food commodity prices have significant economic and social impacts, from household budgets to global trade policies. In this competition, participants are challenged to develop predictive models that can speculate on food commodity prices based on historical data. The dataset provided includes various features such as previous prices, currency exchange rates, global supply trends, and macroeconomic indicators. By using this data, participants are expected to be able to build models that are able to predict the price of each commodity on each date at a certain time interval with a high degree of accuracy.

The goal of this competition is to encourage data scientists to hone their skills in building accurate predictive models. By participating, participants contribute to a deeper understanding of food price movements and their impact on food security and economic stability. In addition to improving technical skills, this competition also focuses on the importance of data-driven decision-making in managing the food supply chain and reducing the risk of price volatility.
